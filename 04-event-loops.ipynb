    "In the previous chapter, we stated that one use for a value-returning generator is to have a long running computation be able to both return a final value, but also suspend itself in the middle of its computation in order to give other computations a chance to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaving computations can also be accomplished by spawning threads. But performing concurrent tasks in a single thread has a number of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spawning threads usually has a higher overhead.\n",
    "- Spawning threads requires more coordination with the operating system.\n",
    "- The Python Global Interpretter Lock (GIL) prevents multiple threads from running pure Python code at the same time. True parallelism can only be achieved while threads are blocked on I/O. For multiple CPU bound tasks, threads offer no more parallelism than an event loop does.\n",
    "- Well written event loops (such as `asyncio`) are able to achieve parallelism when tasks yield due to an I/O operation. So even with I/O bound tasks, event loops can perform just as well (or better than) threads.\n",
    "- Generators inside an event loop can control when context switches will occur (at every `yield` or `yield from`, but no where else), and developers can easily see this when reading the code.\n",
    "  - This creates fewer opportunities for \"thread\"-unsafe operations to accidentally occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a single thread, multiple tasks can be coordinated using an event loop. An event loop constantly loops (usually forever), and runs a single step of a single task for each run through the loop, as long as there are any tasks that are ready to run."

    "Both interleaved and non-interleaved have the same total runtimes. However, the program may appear to be more responsive in one mode over the other, depending on the scheduled generators. In non-interleaved mode, the number of rounds to complete a particular generator is T + R, where R is the number of rounds to complete that generator in isolation, and T is the total number of rounds to complete all of the generators that were scheduled before it. Whereas, in interleaved mode, the number of rounds is, at most, (N * R) + R, where N is the number of other generators in the event loop (not including itself). Let's consider how these behave under various conditions:\n",
    "- One task: No difference.\n",
    "- One short task followed by one long task: No matter what, the long task will complete at the same time. But the short task will take slightly longer in interleaved mode.\n",
    "- One long task followed by one short task: The long task will finish slightly faster in non-interleaved mode, but the short task will finish much faster in interleaved mode.\n",
    "- Many tasks of equal length: In non-interleaved mode, one generator will complete every R rounds. In interleaved mode, a long time will pass without completing any generators, but towards the end many generators will complete in rapid succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaved mode isn't guaranteed to be better, but it is probably expected to perform better on average. In this mode, if there are only a few generators, then short tasks will always complete fast. Whereas the more generators there are in the run loop, the slower every generator will run, but each generator is penalized proportionally to its size. Non-interleaved mode can sometimes perform better, but since it penalizes based on position in the queue and based on the sizes of previous generators, it can cause massive and unfair slowdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, switching from non-interleaved to interleaved mode has the following effects:\n",
    "- `factorial(12)` goes from completing after 10 rounds, to completing after 18\n",
    "- `factorial(8)` goes from completing after 16 rounds, to completing after 14\n",

Because the loop runs an arbitrary number of generators and could potentially run forever, it can't return the results that it computes. Thus, if the final values are meant to be used in some computation, then the computation must be specified in a callback, and the event loop must call the callback with the result.\n",

    "This is a bit closer to a realistic event loop. It doesn't have most of the features of `asyncio` or similar event loops, but it does cover the very basic requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see more clearly now that the event loop requires committment. Unless you're using `run_until_complete()` to block on a specific task and then exit the event loop, the event loop is most likely going to control execution for the rest of the program. Thus, all program logic needs to occur in generators/tasks and callbacks. These tasks will perform units of work, and may spawn other tasks and callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in order for the event loop to run well, you want each unit of work to end with a `yield`. Usually a task would `yield` after initiating some non-blocking I/O operation (more on this later), but can also `yield` in the middle of a long computation, or when waiting for some other task to complete (which we'll see in the next chapter). Any task which hogs the event loop will lower the perceived performance of all other tasks. Thus, a call like `requests.get(URL)` is inappropriate in an event loop, because it does blocking I/O (moreover, it might make multiple HTTP calls, if it has to deal with retries or redirects). All I/O ideally must use event loop-aware variants."
