It also must be configured with a mode, either interleaved or non-interleaved.\n",

    "Both interleaved and non-interleaved have the same total runtimes. However, the program may appear to be more responsive in one mode over the other, depending on the scheduled generators. In non-interleaved mode, the number of rounds to complete a particular generator is T + R, where R is the number of rounds to complete that generator in isolation, and T is the total number of rounds to complete all of the generators that were scheduled before it. Whereas, in interleaved mode, the number of rounds is, at most, (N * R) + R, where N is the number of other generators in the event loop (not including itself). Let's consider how these behave under various conditions:\n",
    "- One task: No difference.\n",
    "- One short task followed by one long task: No matter what, the long task will complete at the same time. But the short task will take slightly longer in interleaved mode.\n",
    "- One long task followed by one short task: The long task will finish slightly faster in non-interleaved mode, but the short task will finish much faster in interleaved mode.\n",
    "- Many tasks of equal length: In non-interleaved mode, one generator will complete every R rounds. In interleaved mode, a long time will pass without completing any generators, but towards the end many generators will complete in rapid succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaved mode isn't guaranteed to be better, but it is probably expected to perform better on average. In this mode, if there are only a few generators, then short tasks will always complete fast. Whereas the more generators there are in the run loop, the slower every generator will run, but each generator is penalized proportionally to its size. Non-interleaved mode can sometimes perform better, but since it penalizes based on position in the queue and based on the sizes of previous generators, it can cause massive and unfair slowdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, switching from non-interleaved to interleaved mode has the following effects:\n",
    "- `factorial(12)` goes from completing after 10 rounds, to completing after 18\n",
    "- `factorial(8)` goes from completing after 16 rounds, to completing after 14\n",
    "- `factorial(4)` goes from completing after 18 rounds, to completing after 6"
