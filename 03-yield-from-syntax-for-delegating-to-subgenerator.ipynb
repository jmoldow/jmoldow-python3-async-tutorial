Thus, the main purposes of generators were to serve as a special syntax for defining an iterator, and in advanced cases to serve as a general mechanism for suspending and resuming execution of a block of code.\n",

    "3. receive values or instructions via `send()`, `throw()`, and `close()`;\n",
    "4. or simply to allow other computations to be interleaved with it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The language of [PEP 380][] refers to these behaviors in an interesting way. The proposal document has a section titled \"[Generators as Threads][]\". Here is a quote of the most interesting part of that section:\n",
    "\n",
    "[PEP 380]: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/> \"PEP 380 -- Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator\"\n",
    "[Generators as Threads]: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/#generators-as-threads> \"Generators as Threads\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> A motivation for generators being able to return values concerns the use of generators to implement lightweight threads. When using generators in that way, it is reasonable to want to spread the computation performed by the lightweight thread over many functions. One would like to be able to call a subgenerator as though it were an ordinary function, passing it parameters and receiving a returned value.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Using the proposed syntax, a statement such as\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `y = f(x)`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> where f is an ordinary function, can be transformed into a delegation call\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `y = yield from g(x)`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> where g is a generator. One can reason about the behaviour of the resulting code by thinking of g as an ordinary function that can be suspended using a yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they say \"thread\", they don't mean a `threading.Thread` or an operating system thread. Rather, they are referring to a computation, procedure, or program that can be run concurrently with other such threads. This concept will be explored when we talk about event loops and async tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related line of thinking is to view these generators as futures. Suppose again that `g` is a generator function which returns a value. Then `y = yield from g(x)` assigns that return value to `y`. However, since the computation of `g(x)` involves `yield` and possibly `yield from` statements, it will suspend itself one or more times, and the final result will not be available right away. But when the final result is available, it is immediately assigned to `y`, and computation of that function resumes. This isn't quite the same as a future, since futures are objects that can be passed around, mapped, assigned callbacks, etc. And when a function returns a future, the caller's execution is not suspended until/unless the caller decides to explicitly wait on the result. When we explore event loops, we'll see an actual future that takes advantage of `yield from`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not everything is sunshine and rainbows, even with the introduction of `yield from`. Say you are writing a function `f`, and you want to call a function `g` that produces some return value. However, `g` is a generator function, whereas `f` is currently a normal function. Here, you have three options:\n",
    "1. Use `y = yield from g()` to get the return value. However, this will turn `f` into a generator function, which means that its caller(s) need to run `f` or must themselves `yield from f()`, and so on and so forth.\n",
    "2. Run `g()` through to completion, perhaps manually, or perhaps using a helper function like\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def run_until_complete(generator):\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           while True:\n",
    "               next(generator)\n",
    "       except StopIteration as exc:\n",
    "           return exc.value\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This has the downside that your program loses out on the ability to possibly interleave other computations and do concurrent programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reimplement `g` as a non-generator function, and call that function instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going with 1. isn't necessarily a bad thing. But it does show how using generators to represent suspendable computations can be infectious. Later we'll see how this is necessary in order to gain the ability to do async programming."
