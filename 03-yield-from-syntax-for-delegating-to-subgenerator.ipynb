    "[PEP 380]: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/> \"PEP 380 -- Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator\"\n",
    "[Generators as Threads]: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/#generators-as-threads> \"Generators as Threads\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> A motivation for generators being able to return values concerns the use of generators to implement lightweight threads. When using generators in that way, it is reasonable to want to spread the computation performed by the lightweight thread over many functions. One would like to be able to call a subgenerator as though it were an ordinary function, passing it parameters and receiving a returned value.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Using the proposed syntax, a statement such as\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `y = f(x)`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> where f is an ordinary function, can be transformed into a delegation call\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `y = yield from g(x)`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> where g is a generator. One can reason about the behaviour of the resulting code by thinking of g as an ordinary function that can be suspended using a yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they say \"thread\", they don't mean a `threading.Thread` or an operating system thread. Rather, they are referring to a computation, procedure, or program that can be run concurrently with other such threads. This concept will be explored when we talk about event loops and async tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related line of thinking is to view these generators as futures. Suppose again that `g` is a generator function which returns a value. Then `y = yield from g(x)` assigns that return value to `y`. However, since the computation of `g(x)` involves `yield` and possibly `yield from` statements, it will suspend itself one or more times, and the final result will not be available right away. But when the final result is available, it is immediately assigned to `y`, and computation of that function resumes. This isn't quite the same as a future, since futures are objects that can be passed around, mapped, assigned callbacks, etc. And when a function returns a future, the caller's execution is not suspended until/unless the caller decides to explicitly wait on the result. When we explore event loops, we'll see an actual future that takes advantage of `yield from`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not everything is sunshine and rainbows, even with the introduction of `yield from`. Say you are writing a function `f`, and you want to call a function `g` that produces some return value. However, `g` is a generator function, whereas `f` is currently a normal function. Here, you have three options:\n",
    "1. Use `y = yield from g()` to get the return value. However, this will turn `f` into a generator function, which means that its caller(s) need to run `f` or must themselves `yield from f()`, and so on and so forth.\n",
    "2. Run `g()` through to completion, perhaps manually, or perhaps using a helper function like\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def run_until_complete(generator):\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           while True:\n",
    "               step(generator)\n",
    "       except StopIteration as exc:\n",
    "           return exc.value\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This has the downside that your program loses out on the ability to possibly interleave other computations and do concurrent programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reimplement `g` as a non-generator function, and call that function instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going with 1. isn't necessarily a bad thing. But it does show how using generators to represent suspendable computations can be infectious. Later we'll see how this is necessary in order to gain the ability to do async programming."

    "Both interleaved and non-interleaved have the same total runtimes. However, the program may appear to be more responsive in one mode over the other, depending on the scheduled generators. In non-interleaved mode, the number of rounds to complete a particular generator is T + R, where R is the number of rounds to complete that generator in isolation, and T is the total number of rounds to complete all of the generators that were scheduled before it. Whereas, in interleaved mode, the number of rounds is, at most, (N * R) + R, where N is the number of other generators in the event loop (not including itself). Let's consider how these behave under various conditions:\n",
    "- One task: No difference.\n",
    "- One short task followed by one long task: No matter what, the long task will complete at the same time. But the short task will take slightly longer in interleaved mode.\n",
    "- One long task followed by one short task: The long task will finish slightly faster in non-interleaved mode, but the short task will finish much faster in interleaved mode.\n",
    "- Many tasks of equal length: In non-interleaved mode, one generator will complete every R rounds. In interleaved mode, a long time will pass without completing any generators, but towards the end many generators will complete in rapid succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaved mode isn't guaranteed to be better, but it is probably expected to perform better on average. In this mode, if there are only a few generators, then short tasks will always complete fast. Whereas the more generators there are in the run loop, the slower every generator will run, but each generator is penalized proportionally to its size. Non-interleaved mode can sometimes perform better, but since it penalizes based on position in the queue and based on the sizes of previous generators, it can cause massive and unfair slowdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, switching from non-interleaved to interleaved mode has the following effects:\n",
    "- `factorial(12)` goes from completing after 10 rounds, to completing after 18\n",
    "- `factorial(8)` goes from completing after 16 rounds, to completing after 14\n",
    "- `factorial(4)` goes from completing after 18 rounds, to completing after 6"
